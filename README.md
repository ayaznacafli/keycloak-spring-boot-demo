The Spring Boot application you've created is designed to provide RESTful APIs that are secured by Keycloak, ensuring robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Here's a detailed breakdown of the application:

Key Features
5 REST API Endpoints:

These endpoints allow users to interact with different parts of the application, likely providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality or other services depending on the application's requirements.
Each endpoint is protected under Keycloak's security layer, which ensures only authorized users can access them.
Keycloak Integration:

Keycloak is used as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. It manages user authentication, authorization, and session management.
The Spring Boot app likely uses Keycloak’s Java adapter or Spring Security OAuth2 to handle authorization tokens issued by Keycloak.
When a user tries to access any of the API endpoints, they must first authenticate via Keycloak. Once authenticated, they receive a JWT token which is included in their requests to access the protected APIs.
Depending on how roles and permissions are configured in Keycloak, users may have different access levels (e.g., admin, user).
Secured REST APIs:

All API endpoints are configured with security rules, ensuring that only authenticated users with the right roles can access them.
Keycloak's security ensures that sensitive data is protected and that requests are properly authorized before they are processed by the application.
Spring Boot:

The application is developed using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications and microservices.
Spring Boot simplifies the creation of REST APIs by providing built-in tools and configurations such as:
Spring MVC for building RESTful web services.
Spring Security for integrating Keycloak’s authentication and authorization.
Dockerized Environment:

Your application is likely deployed in a containerized environment using Docker, as demonstrated by the docker-compose.yml you shared.
The Keycloak and PostgreSQL services are running in separate containers, making the application easy to scale and manage.
Keycloak's Role in the Application
Authentication: When users attempt to access the REST API, they are redirected to the Keycloak login page. Once successfully logged in, Keycloak issues an access token (usually a JWT) to the user.

Authorization: The application enforces role-based access control (RBAC) using Keycloak. This means different users may have varying levels of access to the API endpoints based on their roles (e.g., admin, user, viewer).

Example Flow of the Application
User sends a request to one of the API endpoints (e.g., POST /api/data).
Keycloak verifies the user's token to ensure they are authenticated and have the correct permissions (based on their assigned roles in the Keycloak realm).
If the user is authorized, the Spring Boot application processes the request and returns the appropriate response.
If the user is not authorized, they receive a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error.
Use Cases for the REST API
The application’s endpoints could serve a variety of business functions, depending on its domain, such as:

Data Management: APIs for managing data entries, like adding, updating, deleting, or retrieving records.
User Operations: APIs for user-related operations, such as profile management, fetching user data, or handling user-specific services.
Admin Operations: APIs for admin users, enabling them to manage other users, handle configurations, or interact with system-level data.
